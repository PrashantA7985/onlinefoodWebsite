                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Bulk Ordering</h2>
                <p class="center">Bulk foods are food items offered in large quantities, which can be purchased in large, bulk lots or transferred from a bulk container into a smaller container for purchase. Bulk foods may be priced less compared to packaged foods because they are typically packaged in large generic bulk containers and packaging for grocery outlets, which utilizes lesser natural resources.Additionally, less packaging is congruent with the environmental conservation of natural resources and sustainability. One study found a 96% reduction in packaging used for bulk foods compared to packaged foods.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Food Ordering</h2>
                <p class="center">There is a huge food delivery market in Southeast Asia. While the food market is a trillion-dollar business,  the delivery market  is only a  small fraction of  this market (Kandasivam, 2017). This presented a big opportunity for future growth.  It is projected that  by the year 2022, the food delivery business will grow to an annual revenue of USD 956 million, which is one of the fastest growing sectors in the food market (EC Insider, 2018). </p>
